# acceloremeter_vector_orientation_for_vehicles

This script computes the acceloremeter orientation for a vehicle without the need of a gyroscope.

It also computes the components of any other vector/acceleration for the given orientation.

It is assumed that the user is able to read the "UPWARD" and "UPWARD_FORWARD" vectors, as described:
  UPWARD VECTOR: it is the raw sensor data when the vehicle is not moving.
  UPWARD_FORWARD: it is the raw sensor data when vehicle is moving forward, to detect
